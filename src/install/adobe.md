# Adobe Flash player

This by far the least laggy way!
In total you must download 4 files: `config.xml`, `localisation.xml`, `ninjago-rush.swf` and an exe file which is the Flash player itself.

1. You can install all these files, by downloading the following zip file: https://github.com/ninjago-rush/ninjago-rush.github.io/raw/refs/heads/main/ninjago-rush.zip
**Note**: install these at a location which you can easily find!
2. Unzip this file (right click and click 'Extract all').
**Note**: keep all files in the same folder, only the exe file (the flashplayer) may be taken out of the folder!
3. Now open the flashplayer and click on 'File' and then 'Open'.
4. Navigate to the previously installed folder.
5. Now click on `ninjago-rush.swf` and you should be done!

Alternatively you may use any program that can run an [swf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF) file.
